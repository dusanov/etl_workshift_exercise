# ETL Workshift Exercise

## Abstract
Task is to collect work shift data from the REST endpoint. The specs for
endpoint are here: https://my.tanda.co/api/v2/documentation#shifts
The endpoint generates random shift data for the previous week. The endpoint just
returns the data, no need to back it with the database. No need to provide authentication.

ETL job that fetches the data from the REST endpoint, transforms the
data and loads it into a database (H2). The resulting
database contains 4 tables:
* breaks - which containс all the `breaks` fetched from the shift data from the API.
* allowances - which contains all the `allowances` fetched from the shift data from
the API
* award_interpretations - which contains all the `award_interpretations` fetched
from the shift data from the API
* shifts - which should contain everything it does except for breaks, allowances,
awar_interpretation properties (arrays);

All the timestamps should be converted to EST timezone;

Breaks, allowances, award_interpretation should be enriched with shift_id
(corresponds to ‘id’ column in the shift object), shift_date (corresponds to ‘date’ in
shift object), sheet_id (corresponds to ‘sheet_id’ in shift object);

## Solution design
This projects consists of two Spring Boot apps:
* WorkShiftRestEndpoint - endpoint for generating random work shift data
* ETLJob - Console app to consume the endpoint, transform and load it to the H2 database.
